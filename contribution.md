For contributing to Numpy I have decided to put one of the main files (pavement.py, at the projects root folder) in PEP8 compliance. I've uploaded both the original and fixed versions of this file on this github account. 

I used PEP8 by Python Foundation for doing so (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8)
